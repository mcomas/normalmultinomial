# 1. Let v3 = v1 X v2.
# 2. Let Q2 be an orthogonal matrix that performs a rotation about v1
# by an arbitrary angle so that Q2 * v1 = v1. This means that v1 is an
# eigenvector of Q2.
# 3. Let Q1 be an orthogonal matrix that performs a rotation about v3
# by the smallest angle between v1 and v2 so that Q1 * v1 = v2.
#
# We can see that Q1 * (Q2 * v1) = v2.  Now define M = Q1 * Q2 so that
#
# M * v1 = v2
#
# Since there are an infinite number of options for Q2, there are an
# infinite number of options for M.  The simplest option is when Q2 = I.
#
# Now you just need to know how to construct an orthogonal matrix for a
# rotation about an axis by a specified angle.  For this, you need
# Rodrigues' Rotation Formula.  Here are two articles that explain it:
